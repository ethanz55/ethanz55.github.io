# Never Starvin'

This is my API Hack capstone Project for Thinkful.
It is a restaurant locator made with the
[Zomato](https://developers.zomato.com/) API to find restaurants in your
city. Specifically created with the
[/geocode](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#!/common/geocode) and
[/restaurant](https://developers.zomato.com/documentation#!/restaurant/restaurant_0)
branches.

## Important Note

The images are preset because Zomato requires a partnership with them
in order to access their photos. The phone number also requires a partnership
or else both features would have been implemented into the project.
